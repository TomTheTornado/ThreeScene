HW6 - Create a scene using Three.js

I started with "../threejsexamples/RotatingCubeWithModel.js", I used the camera controls from the examples.
2 variations of a skybox were present, a snow skybox, and a space skybox. After adding all of that I decided on making the bat signal.
The batman symbol was found on thingiverse and converted to and obj and unwrapped its coordinates in blender. 
The batman logo was modeled in blender by converting an .svg to a mesh and extruding it, also in blender. 
I used heirarchy to create the bat signal that way it could be adjusted easily and controlled. 
Metal textures were addedto the different objects as well. 
I decided to render the Batman '66 logo in the framebuffer and give the ability to change the background colors of it. 
The purple cubes use heirarchy, are animated, and have a blue spotlight following the top cube. 
I also added a green spotlight around the batsignal. Though I didn't add all 6 walls for a room that way it was easier to see the skybox.

I used the examples to help with the skybox, textures, camera controls, heirarchy, and using obj loader
