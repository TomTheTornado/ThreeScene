	<li>Started with "../threejsexamples/RotatingCubeWithModel.js", I used the camera controls from the examples.
		I added 2 variations of a skybox, a snow skybox, and a space skybox. After adding all of that I decided on making the bat signal.
		I found the batman symbol on thingiverse and converted it to and obj and unwrapped its coordinates in blender. I modeled the batman logo in blender by converting an .svg to a mesh and extruding it. I used heirarchy to create the bat signal that way it could be adjusted easily. I added metal textures to the different objects as well. I decided to render the Batman '66 logo in the framebuffer and give the ability to change the background colors of it. I added more spotlights around the bat signal as well, this time showing off different colors of the light.
